# LSTM_Stock_Predictor

In this repo, you will find my assignment around LSTM. 

The btc closing and btc fear and greed csv were cleaned to then build a model around to attempt to predict. There are a few things you can play around with to get different answers that might be more desirable like the 'batch_size' (stick to lower numbers) and 'epochs' (Use at least 10)

Initially, I got more accurate predictions in my closing notebooks than those that were sampled and there to guide me. This goes to show that making the slight changes does make a difference. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my code.
